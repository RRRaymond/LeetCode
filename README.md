# LeetCode Solution

> A python3 solution to LeetCode algorithm problems.

Since all courses of the junior year in the university is finished, I decide to create this repository to recording my progress on LeetCode.

If it goes well, I'll start from the easy ones to hard ones. And for each interesting problem, I'll write some ideas and notes to help myself have a better understanding of algorithm and data structure.

I'll be extremely happy if it will be helpful for anyone find my code.
